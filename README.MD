## Introduction
Fine-tuning GPT-3 with OpenAI is a powerful technique that allows you to customize the pre-trained GPT-3 model to suit your specific needs. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps required to fine-tune GPT-3 with OpenAI, and how to deploy a demo Streamlit chatbot using your fine-tuned GPT-3 model.


## Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hungcao0402/finetune-gpt3
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd finetune-gpt3
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Open notebook "seminar_notebook.ipynb" and run to fine-tune.


5. Run the following script to start the Stream web:

```bash
streamlit run steamlit_demo.py
```

6. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the chatbot interface.
